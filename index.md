Hi! I'm Katie, a geneticist and data scientist at Northwestern University. I love analyzing data and, even more, I love finding new solutions to help others analyze their data! You need to do some analysis? I've got a script for that. And if I don't, nothing would give me more pleasure than to create an R shiny application or a reproducible computational pipeline to help you do it more efficiently in the future. I have a deeply-rooted passion for helping to cure childhood cancer, as I lost someone close to me way too young in life. I also strongly believe in the power of education and thoroughly enjoy taking the time to teach and mentor the next generation.

### My graduate research in a nutshell
I recieved my PhD in 2020 from the Interdisciplinary Biological Sciences ([IBiS](https://ibis.northwestern.edu/)) program at Northwestern University under the advisement of Dr. Erik Andersen. In the [Andersen Lab](https://andersenlab.org/), I used the microscopic worm *Caenorhabditis elegans* and a combination of both experimental and computational methods to help understand the genetics behind why individuals responded differently to the same drug treatments. If you are interested to learn more about my research, check out my [blog]("https://phdisney.home.blog/"), or my [projects]("projects") or [publications]("publications") pages! I also love to talk about my research, so don't hesitate to [reach out]("contactme")!

### But Katie, are you only a scientist?
I do LOVE science, but I also have many other passions! Most nights you can find me with my nose stuck in a novel, hungry to explore new worlds. I am an avid tennis fan and love to both play and watch the sport in my free time. And I find any excuse to travel, seeking out more time in nature away from the stress of daily life.
