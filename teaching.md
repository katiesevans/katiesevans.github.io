# Courses

Feel like your statistics knowledge could use a refresh? This Fall, I am excited to be teaching "[Quantitative Biology: Statistics and Data Analysis for Life Scientists](https://github.com/katiesevans/IGP_biostatistics)" for incoming graduate students at Northwestern University. Follow along to learn more about the basic application of statistics and data science techniques in research.
